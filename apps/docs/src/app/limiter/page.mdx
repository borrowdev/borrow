# Limiter

Limiter is a serverless **rate limiting API**.
You'll usually call Limiter before you start executing your function logic, especially
expensive logic such as database scans or AI inferences.\
Using a rate limiter can ensure your services don't get overwhelmed, which can potentially save you thousands of dollars.

## Infrastructure

Behind the scenes we use [Redis](https://redis.io/) with data persistence to provide an accurate and fast atomic counter.

Imagine you have an AI inference endpoint that effectively costs you around $0.01 per request and allows
signed up users to use it for free. If you allow them to make however many requests they want, the request rate
will be impossible to predict and you'll have no way to control your costs.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Limiter is currently not suitable for DoS protection, you should use it only for rate limiting regular usage.
> It should be seen as a tool to help you have more predictable costs and to prevent your services from being overwhelmed by too many requests under normal circumstances.
>
> In its current state, it should NOT be used as a tool to prevent malicious attacks, such as [DoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).
> We highly recommend you take a holistic approach to cost control and security, using Limiter as only part of your overall strategy. 

Implementing a rate limiter from scratch can be a complex task, the pitfalls are many, and the cost of mistakes is usually high if things go south.\
It becomes even more complex when you want to support multiple rate limiting algorithms at the same time.

We made Limiter so you don't have to worry about these complexities.\
As a bonus, since [our philosophy](/#philosophy) is to provide the best developer experience possible, you'll most likely find using our APIs intuitive and easy.
