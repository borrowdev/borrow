# Supabase Integration

The TS/JS client library for limiter is integrated with Supabase to make your life easier as a developer.

The way it works is if you want to rate limit a user ID, instead of getting the environment variables, creating a Supabase instance, and parsing the authentication token, 
you can simply pass the request object to the limiter function and we'll handle the rest for you!

You can also pass only the request object to the limiter function and it'll automatically create a unique key for the request based on the request URL.

This might have diminishing returns for when you already need the user object anyway, but for simple use cases where you just want to protect an endpoint and return a response
without touching the user object, this greatly simplifies the whole process!

Here's how it works:

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "JavaScript", "curl"]} defaultValue="TypeScript">
	<Tabs.Tab value="TypeScript">
```ts copy
import { borrow } from "@borrowdev/node";
// ... Your Supabase Edge Function handler

const { success, timeLeft } = await borrow.limiter(req, {
	limiters: [{
		interval: 20,
		maxRequests: 10,
		type: "fixed",
	}]
});

// ... Your expensive business logic
```
	</Tabs.Tab>
	<Tabs.Tab value="JavaScript">
```js copy
import { borrow } from "@borrowdev/node";
// ... Your Supabase Edge Function handler

const { success, timeLeft } = await borrow.limiter(req, {
	limiters: [{
		interval: 20,
		maxRequests: 10,
		type: "fixed",
	}]
});

// ... Your expensive business logic
```
	</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
