# Introduction

Borrow is an open-source serverless toolkit for developers.\
We aim to make it easier for developers to perform common but noticeably time-consuming tasks.

## REST API

While we recommend you use our client libraries when possible, we also provide a [REST API](https://borrow.apidocumentation.com/reference) which our libraries are built on top of.

## Philosophy

Borrow is built on the principle that the most important thing when creating APIs is Developer Experience (DX).\
We believe that a great DX is the key to building successful APIs.

Of course, there are many other factors that contribute to a successful developer _product_, a few of them are security, scalability, community, support, etc.\
We're not saying that these factors aren't important, but rather that as we develop Borrow, developer experience is our top priority.

Here are some of the practical ways we make sure our APIs have a great developer experience:

- **In-Editor Comments**: We provide comprehensive in-editor comments (JSDoc on TS/JS) for all our APIs, so you can easily understand how to use them without ever leaving your code editor.
- **Handmade Documentation**: We do **not** use auto-generated documentation. This makes sure we can provide more extensive and tailored documentation depending on the context and environment.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: We've adopted the [Progressive Disclousure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure) UX principle to developer tools, this means we only show the most basic
  information upfront to get the job done, and provide more advanced features and options as you dig deeper into the documentation. This reflects even in the types of the client APIs we write.
- **Integrations**: We're constantly extending support for integrations with popular libraries, frameworks, and environments, so you can write less code and accomplish the same goal.

## Getting Started

Borrow only offers one API at the moment, a serverless and self-hostable/fully-managed rate limiter.\
To get started, you can check out the [Limiter Quick Start Guide](/limiter).
